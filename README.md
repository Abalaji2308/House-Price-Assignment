## General Information
- Advanced linear regression is performed on the dataset.
- The project is done as part of coursework in the Machine Learning module. 
- Objective is to model the price of houses with the available independent variables. 
- Regularization with ridge and lasso regression used. 

<!-- You don't have to answer all the questions - just the ones relevant to your project. -->

## Conclusions
1) We have cleaned and visualized the data, treated for outlier and imputed values as and when required and prepared the model for training.

2) The train and test scores for linear regression were 92.15% and 89.29% respectively.

3) The train and test scores for ridge regression were 92.15% and 89.25% respectively.

4) The train and test scores for lasso regression were 91.69% and 88.64% respectively.
